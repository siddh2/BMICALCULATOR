# BMICALCULATOR
BMI CALCULATOR
The core of the project centered around accurately computing the BMI value using the BMI formula. After calculating the BMI, the application instantly categorized the user into one of the following categories: Underweight, Healthy Weight, Overweight, or Obese. This immediate feedback mechanism provided users with a clear understanding of their health status about their BMI value. The project emphasized the importance of dynamically displaying the calculated BMI value and the associated health assessment. The project incorporated a recalculation function to allow users to input different values for weight and height without having to refresh the page. Alongwith this, teaching how to manipulate the DOM to showcase the result prominently, ensures that users receive instant feedback upon entering their weight and height.
